Tree density inside the reserve is higher in the areas of Sal forests and lowest in the Anogeissusâ€“Acacia catechu forests.[15] Total tree basal cover is greater in Sal dominated areas of woody vegetation.[15] Healthy regeneration in sapling and seedling layers is occurring in the Mallotus philippensis, Jamun and Diospyros spp. communities, but in the Sal forests the regeneration of sapling and seedling is poor.[15] A research survey in the 1970s recorded 488 different plant species;[5] in 2023, 617 species were noted, including 110 tree species.[14] A profile of the reserve compiled by the Wildlife Institute of India, listed the sal tree (S. robusta), Adina cordifolia, Anogeissus latifolia, Bauhinia rausinosa, Cassia fistula, and M. philippensis as the notable tree species.[14]
