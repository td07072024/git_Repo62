Jim Corbett National Park is located partly along Doon Valley between the Lesser Himalaya in the north and the Siwalik Hills in the south; it has a sub-Himalayan belt structure.[3] The upper tertiary rocks are exposed towards the base of the Shiwalik range and hard sandstone units form broad ridges.[3] Characteristic longitudinal valleys, geographically termed Doons, or Duns can be seen formed along the narrow tectonic zones between lineaments.[3] The elevation of the region ranges between 360 m (1,180 ft) and 1,040 m (3,410 ft).[3] It has numerous ravines, ridges, minor streams and small plateaus with varying aspects and degrees of slope.[3] The park encompasses the Patli Dun valley formed by the river Ramganga.[13] Its present area is 1,288.31 km2 (497.42 sq mi) including a 822 km2 (317 sq mi) core zone and 466.31 km2 (180.04 sq mi) of buffer area.[14]
